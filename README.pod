=head1 NAME

Alien::Gnuplot - Find and verify functionality of the gnuplot executable.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package MyGnuplotter;

 use strict;

 use Alien::Gnuplot;

 $gnuplot = $Alien::Gnuplot::executable;

 `$gnuplot < /tmp/plotfile`;

 1;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

As an Alien module, Alien::Gnuplot just verifies existence and sanity
of the gnuplot executable.  It doesn't have any methods.  Using
Alien::Gnuplot checks for existence of the executable, and also 
sets several global variables:

=over 3

=item * C<$Alien::Gnuplot::executable> gets the path to the executable that was found.

=item * C<$Alien::Gnuplot::version> gets the self-reported version number of the executable.

=item * C<$Alien::Gnuplot::pl> gets the self-reported patch level.

=item * C<@Alien::Gnuplot::terms> gets a list of the names of all supported terminal devices

=item * C<%Alien::Gnuplot::terms> gets a key for each supported terminal device; values are the 1-line description from gnuplot.

=back

You can point Alien::Gnuplot to a particular path for gnuplot, by setting the 
environment variable GNUPLOT_BINARY to the path.

If there is no executable application in your path or in the location pointed
to by GNUPLOT_BINARY, then the module throws an exception.  You can also verify that
it has not completed successfully, by examining $Alien::Gnuplot::version, which is
undefined in case of failure and contains the gnuplot version string on success.
